## Contact Customer Success Team

Weka's technical support policy is based on the type and urgency of the inquiry, as described in the following table:

| **Type/Urgency**                          | **Method of contact**                                                                                                                                                                        | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Weka provides only remote support as part of its SLA.&#x20;

The SLA detailed in the technical support policy is for Weka software issues. Issues that are caused by faulty hardware will depend on the hardware provider and Weka will not be responsible for the hardware provider timelines and/or response time.&#x20;

## Recommended actions

To be ready to get support from Weka, it is recommended to perform the following:

1. For each cluster provisioned, [allow uploading events to the support cloud](the-wekaio-support-cloud.md) to enable proactive support and improve the troubleshooting process if needed
2. Create an account on the Weka Support Portal [support.weka.io](http://support.weka.io/).  This will allow you to easily submit and check the status of tickets and browse our online knowledgebase.
3. We suggest opening a shared Slack channel with Weka for day-to-day activities, Slack activity will not substitute opening tickets for issues and Weka does not guarantee any response time SLA while using Slack. To arrange the slack channel, get in touch with your Weka point of contact, open a case in our support portal at [support.weka.io](http://support.weka.io/) or send an email to [support@weka.io](mailto:support@weka.io).

## Escalation

If you feel that our response has been inadequate or there is room for improvement with our response, you can escalate an incident to our management team. Call Weka Support at +1 (844) 392-0665, choose the escalation option and leave a voicemail requesting escalation of an issue. This escalation request will get to one of our executive managers, depending on the time of day and their time zones. We work in a “follow the sun” approach, so one of the executive managers will be available to take your escalation request.
