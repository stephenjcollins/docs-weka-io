# Alerts

Alerts indicate problematic ongoing states that the cluster is suffering from. To dismiss an alert, you need to resolve the root cause of the alert.

For each alert, the system provides the alert name, its description, and the corrective action.

Usually, an alert is introduced alongside an equivalent event. This can help in identifying the point in time that the problematic state occurred and its root cause.
