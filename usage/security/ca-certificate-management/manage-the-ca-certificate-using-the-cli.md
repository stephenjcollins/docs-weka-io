# Manage the CA certificate using the CLI

The system uses well-known CA certificates to establish trust with external services. For example, when using a KMS. If a different CA certificate is required for Weka servers to establish trust, set this custom CA certificate on the Weka servers.

Use the CLI command:

`weka security ca-cert set`
