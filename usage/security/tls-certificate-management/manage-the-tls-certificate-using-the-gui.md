# Manage the TLS certificate using the GUI

Once the system installation is completed, the cluster TLS certificate is enabled with an auto-generated self-signed certificate to access the GUI, CLI, and API through HTTPS. If you have a custom TLS certificate, you can set it instead of the auto-generated self-signed certificate.

You can also download the existing TLS certificate for later use if you want to use the self-signed certificate.
