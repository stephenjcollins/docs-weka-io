# Events

WEKA events indicate relevant information concerning the WEKA cluster and customer environment. Triggered by a customer operation or an environment change, events can be informational, indicate an issue in the system, or indicate a previously resolved issue.

The WEKA system sends all events to a predefined central monitoring system.
