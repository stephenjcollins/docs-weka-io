# Events

WEKA events provide essential information about the WEKA cluster and customer environment. These timestamped events can be triggered by cluster and customer operations or changes in the environment. They may convey information, signal a system issue, or report a previously resolved problem.

The WEKA cluster sends all events to a predefined central monitoring system, WEKA Home or Local WEKA Home. The GUI displays the events retrieved from the central monitoring system.
