# Manage events using the GUI

With the GUI, you can:

* [View events](events.md#view-events)
* [Filter events](events.md#filter-events)

## View events

The events enable you to investigate issues that occur in the system.

The System Events page provides the following details:

* **Severity**: The severity of the event. The options are Info (lowest), Warning, Minor, Major, and Critical (highest).
* **Timestamp**: The date and time the event occurred. You can switch the display time between local and system time through the top bar.
* **Origin**: The originator of the event. For example, when a user creates a filesystem, the username appears as the event's originator.
* **Category**: The category options include Alerts, Cloud, Clustering, Config, Custom, Drive, Events, Filesystem, InterfaceGroup, Kms, Licensing, NFS, Network, Node, ObjectStorage, Org, Raid, Resources, S3, Security, Smb, System, Traces, Upgrade, and User.
* **Name**: The name of the event.
* **Description**: The description of the event.

You can select the Advanced switch to display internal events. This option is helpful for experts investigating internal issues.

## Filter events

You can filter the events according to the event severity, timestamp, category, or event name. You can also filter events by multiple categories and multiple event names.

**Procedure**

1.  To display events of a specific minimum severity:

    * Select the filter icon of the **Severity** column.
    * Select the required minimum severity.

    For example, if you select the Major severity, also the Critical events are displayed.
