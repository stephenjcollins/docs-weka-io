# Expansion of Specific Resources

## Dynamic Modifications

Most modifications to host configurations can be performed dynamically, without deactivating the host. Such configurations include the addition/removal of memory and network resources, changing IPs, extending network subnets and limiting the Weka system bandwidth on the host.&#x20;

All these changes can be performed using the relevant `weka cluster host`command. Once this command is used with a specific `host-id`selected, it will be staged for update on the cluster. To view the un-applied configuration, use the `weka cluster host resources <host-id>`command. To apply the changes, use the `weka cluster host apply <host-ids>` command. You can also apply these changes locally using the `weka local resources apply` command.

The last local configuration (of a host that successfully joined a cluster) is saved. If a failure/problem occurs with the new configuration, the host will automatically revert to the last known good configuration. To view this configuration, use the`weka cluster host resources <host-id> --stable` command.&#x20;

### Memory Modifications

To dynamically change the memory configuration, use the steps described for the [Configuration of Memory](../../install/bare-metal/using-cli.md#stage-10-configuration-of-memory-optional) on an active host, followed by the `weka cluster host apply` command.

{% hint style="success" %}
**For Example:** To change `host-id 0` memory to 1.5 GB, run the following commands:

`weka cluster host memory 0 1.5GB`\
`weka cluster host apply 0`
{% endhint %}

#### Release hugepages on each container

After reducing the memory allocation for a container, it is required to release the hugepages on each container.

Perform the following steps for each container:

1. Obtain the `release_hugepages.sh` script below and copy it to the `/opt/weka/` folder.
2. Change the script mode: Run `chmod a+x release_hugepages.sh`
3. Stop the container locally: Run `weka local stop`
4. Release hugepages: Run `weka local run /opt/weka/release_hugepages.sh`
5. Restart the container locally: Run `weka local start`

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/release_hugepages.sh" %}

### Network Modifications

To dynamically change the network configuration, use the steps described for the [Configuration of Networking](../../install/bare-metal/using-cli.md#stage-6-configuration-of-networking) on an active host, followed by the`weka cluster host apply` command.

{% hint style="success" %}
**For Example:** To add another network device to `host-id 0`, run the following commands:

`weka cluster host net add 0 eth2`\
`weka cluster host apply 0`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** It is possible to accumulate several changes on a host and apply only once on completion.
{% endhint %}

### Host IPs Modifications

To dynamically change the host's management IPs, you can use the `management-ips` resource editing command.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**For Example:** To change the management IPs on`host-id 0`, run the following commands:

`weka cluster host management-ips 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.20`\
`weka cluster host apply 0`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The number of management IPs determines whether the host will use Highly Available Networking mode (HA), causing each IO process to use both hosts NICs. A host with 2 IPs will use HA mode and a host with only 1 IP will not use HA mode. It is also possible to define up to 4 IPs, in case the cluster is using both Infiniband and Ethernet network technologies.
{% endhint %}

### Local resources editing commands

It is also possible to run modification commands locally on the host by connecting to the desired host and running a `local resources` command equivalent to its `weka cluster host` counterpart. These local commands have the same semantics of their remote counterparts only that they don't receive the host-id as the first parameter and operate instead on the local host.&#x20;

Commands that can be performed dynamically on an Active host:

`weka local resources [--stable]`\
`weka local resources apply`\
`weka local resources net`\
`weka local resources net add`\
`weka local resources net remove`\
`weka local resources memory`\
`weka local resources bandwidth`\
`weka local resources management-ips`\
`weka local resources dedicate`

The following commands cannot be performed on an Active host and require deactivating the host first using `weka cluster host deactivate`:

`weka local resources failure-domain`\
`weka local resources cores`

## Addition of CPU Cores

The addition of CPU cores to the cluster is not performed dynamically but on an inactive host. It requires the execution of the steps described in [Configuration of CPU Resources](../../install/bare-metal/using-cli.md#stage-9-configuration-of-cpu-resources).&#x20;

For more information, contact the WekaIO Support Team.

## Expansion of Only SSDs

Follow the instructions appearing in [Configuration of SSDs](../../install/bare-metal/using-cli.md#stage-6-configuration-of-ssds).
