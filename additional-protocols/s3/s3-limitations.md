## General Limits

## Naming Limitations

### Buckets

* Bucket names must be between 3 and 63 characters long.
* Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-).
* Bucket names must begin and end with a letter or number.
* Bucket names must not be formatted as IP addresses (for example, 192.168.5.4).
* Bucket names must be unique across the cluster.

### Objects

* Object key names must be up to 1024 characters long.
* A `/` prefix of an object is interpreted as a directory, and such directory segments are limited to 255 characters.
* Refer to [AWS S3 object name limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html). Match them to limitations in other protocols.

**Note:** It is advisable to avoid special characters that might be unsupported using protocols other than S3.&#x20;

## Policy Limitations

### Supported S3 Policy Actions

The S3 protocol implementation supports the following policy actions:

* `s3:*`
  * Note: this wildcard is supported for IAM policies but not for bucket policies
* `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`
* `s3:CreateBucket`
* `s3:DeleteBucket`
* `s3:DeleteBucketPolicy`
* `s3:DeleteObject`
* `s3:GetBucketLocation`
* `s3:GetBucketPolicy`
* `s3:GetObject`
* `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
* `s3:ListBucket`
* `s3:PutBucketPolicy`
* `s3:PutObject`
* `s3:GetBucketTagging`
* `s3:PutBucketTagging`
* `s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration`
* `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`
* `s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads`
* `s3:ListMultipartUploadParts`

## Lifecycle Configuration

Weka supports the [AWS S3 Lifecycle Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intro-lifecycle-rules.html) elements and definitions, with the limitation of only supporting the lifecycle `Expiration` action.

## Quotas

Currently, data ingested by the S3 protocol is not counted against a defined directory quota.
