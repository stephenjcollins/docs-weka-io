# NFS

## Overview

The NFS protocol allows client hosts to access the Weka filesystem without installing Wekaâ€™s client software using the standard NFS implementation of the client host operating system. While this implementation is easier to deploy, it does not compare in performance to the Weka client.

In order to implement NFS service from a Weka cluster, the following steps must be implemented:

| **Step**                                                                                                            | **Method of Implementation**                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Define a set of hosts that will provide the NFS service, which can be the whole cluster or a subset of the cluster. | By defining an interface group.                                           |
| Define Ethernet ports on each of the defined hosts that will be used to provide the NFS service.                    | By defining an interface group.                                           |
| Allocate a pool of IP addresses that will be used by the Weka software to provide the NFS service.                  | By defining an interface group.                                           |
| Define a Round-robin DNS name that will resolve to the floating IPs.                                                | On the local DNS service configuration; does not involve Weka management. |
| Define the list of client hosts that will be permitted to access file systems via NFS.                              | By creating a client permission group.                                    |
| Configure which client hosts can access which file system.                                                          | By creating a client permission group.                                    |
| Mount the file systems on the client hosts using the NFS mount operating system support.                            | On the client operating system; does not involve Weka management.         |

### Defining the NFS Networking Configuration (Interface Groups)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Since only a single port can be added to an interface group, for HA support in NFS, two interface groups must be created, with each of the host ports assigned to a different interface group. Additionally, the network topology (switches) must be considered when assigning the other host ports to these interface groups, to ensure that a single point of failure is not created in the switch.
{% endhint %}

## Implementing NFS Service from a Weka Cluster

In order to define the NFS service, one or more interface groups must be defined. An interface group consists of the following:

* A collection of Weka hosts with an Ethernet port for each host, where all the ports must belong to the same layer 2 subnets.
* A collection of floating IPs that serve the NFS protocol on the hosts and ports. All IP addresses must belong to the layer 2 subnet above.
* A routing configuration for the IPs which must comply with the IP network configuration.

Up to 10 different Interface groups can be defined, where multiple interface groups can be used if the cluster needs to connect to multiple layer 2 subnets. Up to 50 hosts can be defined in each interface group.

The Weka system will automatically distribute the IP addresses evenly on each host and port. On failure of the host, the Weka system will reasonably redistribute the IP addresses associated with the failed host on other hosts. To minimize the effect of any host failures, it is recommended to define sufficient floating IPs so that the Weka system can assign 4 floating IPs per host.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The Weka system will configure the host IP networking for the NFS service on the host operating system. It should not be defined by the user.
{% endhint %}

### Configuring the Round-Robin DNS Server

To ensure that the various NFS clients will balance the load on the various Weka hosts serving NFS, it is recommended to define a [Round-robin DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin\_DNS) entry which will resolve to the list of floating IPs, ensuring that client loads will be equally distributed across all hosts.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Make sure to set the TTL (Time to Live) for all A records assigned to the NFS servers to 0 (Zero), this ensures that the IP won't be cached by the client or the DNS server.
{% endhint %}

### Defining NFS Access Control (Client Access Groups)

In order to control which host can access which file system, NFS client permission groups must be defined. Each NFS client permission group contains:

* A list of filters for IP addresses or DNS names of clients that can be connected to the Weka system via NFS.
* A collection of rules that control access to specific filesystems.

### Configuring NFS on the Client

The NFS mount should be configured on the client host via the standard NFS stack operating system. The NFS server IP address should point to the Round-robin DNS name defined above.

## Load Balancing and Resiliency of the NFS Service

The Weka NFS service is a scalable, fully load-balanced, and resilient service that provides continuous service through failures of any kind.

Scalability is implemented by defining many hosts that serve the NFS protocol, thereby enabling the scaling of performance by adding more hosts to the interface group.

Load balancing is implemented via floating IPs. By default, the floating IPs are evenly distributed over all the interface group hosts/ports. When different clients resolve the DNS name into an IP service, each of them receives a different IP address, thereby ensuring that different clients will access different hosts. This allows the Weka system to scale and service thousands of clients.

The same mechanism ensures the resiliency of the service. On a host failure, all IP addresses associated with the failed host will be reassigned to other hosts (using the GARP network messages) and the clients will reconnect to the new hosts without any reconfiguration or service interruption.

## User Groups Resolution

The NFS protocol, using AUTH\_SYS protocol, has a limitation of 16 security groups users can be part of. The protocol truncates the group list to 16 if a user is part of more than 16 groups, and a permissions check can fail for authorized users.

As in many cases, a user can be part of more than 16 security groups. It is possible to configure the Weka system to ignore the groups passed by the NFS protocol and resolve the user's groups external to the protocol. For that, several steps should be taken:

1. Define an interface group that supports external group-IDs resolution (`allow-manage-gids` option).
2. Define the NFS client permissions to use external group-IDs resolution (`manage-gids` option).
3. Set-up the relevant hosts to retrieve user's group-IDs information.

### Setting up the Hosts to Retrieve User's Group-IDs Information

The hosts, which are part of the interface group, can be set to retrieve the user's group-IDs information in any method that is used in the environment. Group resolution can be set by joining to an AD domain, joining a Kerberos domain, using LDAP with a read-only user, etc.

`sssd` should be configured on the host to serve as a group IDs provider. It can be configured directly, using LDAP, for example, or as a proxy to a different `nss` group IDs provider.

Below is an example of how to set `sssd` directly for `nss` services using LDAP with a read-only user.

```
[sssd]
services = nss
config_file_version = 2
domains = LDAP

[domain/LDAP]
id_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://ldap.example.com
ldap_search_base = dc=example,dc=com

# The DN used to search the ldap directory with. 
ldap_default_bind_dn = cn=ro_admin,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com

# The password of the bind DN.
ldap_default_authtok = password

```

If the method used is not via `sssd`, but a different provider, an `sssd proxy` should be configured on each relevant host. The proxy is used for the Weka container to be able to resolve the groups by whatever method defined on the host. Use the following to configure `sssd proxy` on a host:

```
# install sssd
yum install sssd

# set up a proxy for weka in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
[sssd]
services = nss
config_file_version = 2
domains = proxy_for_weka

[nss]
[domain/proxy_for_weka]
id_provider = proxy
auth_provider = none
 
# the name of the nss lib to be proxied, e.g. ldap, nis, winbind, vas4, etc.
proxy_lib_name = ldap
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** All users must be present and resolved in the method used in `sssd` for groups resolution. For example, in the above example, using LDAP only provider, local users (e.g., a local root) that are not present in LDAP will not get their groups resolved and will be denied. An LDAP user will need to be added for such users/applications.
{% endhint %}

### **Setting Interface Group IPs**

**Setting Interface Group IPs using the GUI**

Access the Group IPs table.

![Group IPs Table](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

To set IPs for the selected group, click the '+' button on the top right-hand side of the Group IPs table. Then enter the relevant IP range and click Save.

To remove an IP, click the trash symbol displayed next to the IP in the table.

**Setting Interface Group IPs using the CLI**

**Commands:** `weka nfs interface-group ip-range add`and `weka nfs interface-group ip-range delete`

Use the following command lines to add/delete an interface group IP:\
`weka nfs interface-group ip-range add <name> <ips>`\
`weka nfs interface-group ip-range delete <name> <ips>`

**Parameters in Command Line**

| **Name** | **Type** | **Value**            | **Limitations** | **Mandatory** | **Default** |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `name`   | String   | Interface group name | None            | Yes           |             |
| `ips`    | String   | IP range             | Valid IP range  | Yes           |             |

### **Configuring the Service mountd Port**

The mountd service is responsible to get clients' mount requests to the NFS server. When working with interface groups (with `allow-manage-gids=on`), it is possible to set it explicitly, rather than have it randomly selected on each server startup. This allows an easier setup of the firewalls to allow that port.

Use the following command to set and view the mountd configuration: `weka nfs global-config set --mountd-port <mountd-port>` and `weka nfs global-config show`
