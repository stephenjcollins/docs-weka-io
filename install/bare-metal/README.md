{% hint style="info" %}
The following topics are related to installing a homogeneous WEKA system configuration, where all the cluster servers are similar and have the same number of cores, memory, SSD capacity per server, and servers per failure domain (if any). For installation of a heterogeneous configuration, contact the [Customer Success Team](../../support/getting-support-for-your-weka-system.md#contact-customer-success-team).
